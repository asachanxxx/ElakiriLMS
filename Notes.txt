Let's start with basics.
1. simple Asp.net Web APi for backend
2. Angular app for front.

we can have one or more topic
EX: angular

then under each topic we can have one or more Sub topics
EX Angular
	- DI

under each sub topic you can have list of notes
	- Notes
	- Referal Links
	
so this notes can be added easyly. we need a navigation bar for each topic on left hand side. and then we would need another nav when we hover over a topic on somewhere suitable. then system must load all the notes in proper way from latest . and can be search using note name and filter out that one note.
